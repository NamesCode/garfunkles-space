Fuck the government.

The online safety bill is a mess of poorly thought out ides, backed up by "magic" software along with privacy infringement and a dash of "save the children".

If you haven't heard about it already, the online safety bill is the UK's new bill aiming to help protect young people on the internet.
Proposed by the conservative party, this law aims to help in two ways:
- backdooring e2ee to scan messages
- Requiring age verification on sites that contain "harmful" content to minors

## Why this is a bad idea
### Censorship and the accessability of information
Trying to prevent content viewable by minors, they are by proxy removing the viewability of content for everyone, UK or not.
With the law itself being subjective on what qualifies as possibly causing “psychological harm amounting to at least serious distress.”.

> “Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.”
― Edward Snowden

However, if you're willing to get hands on, there are things you can.

### Matrix and the Fediverse
Assuming based on the kind of people reading this that you've heard of both of these things before.
In the case that you haven't then Matrix and the Fediverse are federated social networks with Matrix being based on its protocol of the same name and the Fediverse primarily using the ActivityPub protocol. 
This really boils down to one big social media being hosted across many different servers that communicate with each other.
The decentralised nature of these protocols makes it far harder for a governing entity to censor, with the information being across several servers already.
This coupled with the fact that Matrix supports e2ee out of the box allows us to both keep privacy and avoid censorship from invasive laws like these.
The best way to imagine what Matrix and the Fediverse is by using email. With Email even if your on gmail you can still mail your friend on hotmail.

You could easily get a Matrix or Mastodon instance up and running on something like an old computer you have up in your attic!
