              This awful website has taken me far to long to make and go live, with many hiccups along the way.
              It's meant to have an early internet vibe but I don't really think I pulled it off. This website still
              isn't finished and any feedback on how I could improve it would be greatly appreciated!

              <p>I personally prefer emoticons to emojis and find it annoying to open a browser just to go to <a

                using egui which can be opened with a single key press.<br><sub>of course once I start this the
                  website goes down (￣ ￣|||)</sub></p>

              <p>Whilst I love Svelte syntax, I find myself wanting to use it without the JS bloat and within my Rust
                backends. Because of this I've started work on a Svelte-like templating engine in Rust. C-FFI will be
                introduced eventually.</p>

              <p>Velox serves as a cli frontend for Vel (It's actually what I use to build this website ^^). It's

              <p>I run a small custom pin manufacturing thing and I'm planning on creating a website for it so that I
                can ship globally ^^. The website will be like your average ecommerce with an area where you can
                browse premade pins, wholesale enamel pins and design a custom 25mm badge. Pins will hopefully be
                shipped world wide with payments handled by stripe. We will not hold any user data besides records of
                purchases and custom badge order ids, these invoices and designs will be stored anonymously with the
                user having to remember their order id. We already have the domain for it! <a

              <p>I'm unaware of any simple game engines (This is more of a framework) for creating games for the
                terminal so I think it'd be fun to make something to do so. I want it to provide templates for output,
                easy to use bindings for audio playback and the ability to display images to the terminal either as
                text or using new image api's. I'll probably write a core framework for use in Rust and library
                interfacing then make a full app using egui or iced which provides node based editing for scenes and
                scripting with Lua.</p>

              <p>Since Big Zuc and the rest of big tech are pushing for VR, I thought it'd be funny to make an FOSS
                way to view the <span class="hover-info">potential metaverse<span class="hover-info-text">I doubt this
                    will ever be a thing but it
                    gets hype so hey who know ig lmfao</span></span> in a style similar to
                webbrowsers. I'm going to design it so that the wired engine will implement some basic functionality
                like movement jumping and collisions and the server will send the models (ideally low poly as that'd
                be awful to work with bulky ones) and wasm code that interacts with the browser but it's just an idea.

              <p>Whilst I <strong><em>HATE</em></strong> adverts, I think it'd be fun to have a open source ad agency
                that focuses on privacy and promoting interesting content. For site developers, it could offer the
                option to filter adverts to specific criteria e.g. retro 90s theme, matches to their sites colour
                pallete, only opensource projects, etc. It could offer free ad spaces for those who signup and select
                opensource projects, whilst also helping fund webdevs.</p>

          <p>I was one of the maintainers for <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs">Catppuccin
              Emacs</a> from
            <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs/commit/6aa060373e5d108a3f28fe4d03f75dc82280beb3">
              <time datetime="2022-10-12">October 12th 2022</time>
            </a> to <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs/commit/2f15c7c7cca7834b072bb26421a2755a67786899">

            </a>.<br>
            Admittedly, I don't believe I really contributed as much to to Catppuccin as I gained from being apart of
            the
            community.<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/nyxkrage">Nyx</a> did the majority of the heavy lifting for the Catppuccin emacs
            fork, doing the improved rewrite,<wbr> whereas I just acted in maintenance mode, merging pr's and editing
            lines here and there; Nothing substancial.<br>
            I feel though, from being in Catppuccin, I have been bettered both as a person and as a developer.<br> Going
            from writing shoddy Python in Idle on Windows, being unaware of Unix and writing software properly, to where
            I
            am now of having enough competance with a computer to write my own applications and tools.<br>
            Hell, I didn't even know how to make a website before Catppuccin.<br>
            Whilst I can't owe everything towards then, I owe an unpayable debt and they will forever be a part of my
            journey, not just as a developer but as a person overall.
